Just wanted to send out a quick status report.  I just recently
started to continue work on 3.x and now those changes are in
subversion.  If you are still interested in Denu, I suggest you check
out the berlios subversion repository 3.x is leaps and bounds ahead of
2.x already.  3.x mainly features a better interface with drag and
drop support along with (hopefully) more manageable code.  I'm
currently looking for people to write window manager modules, test
denu on other distros besides Gentoo, write documentation and maintain
the evergrowing denu central database.  All of these positions require
dedication and flexibility because Denu is still in constant change.
Thanks,
Scott
