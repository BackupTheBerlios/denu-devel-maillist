</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I say that because if you look at the generated menu file by denu for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that spec it is sloppy.  It includes multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;Include&gt;&lt;Filename&gt;file&lt;/Filename&gt;&lt;/Include&gt;.  What we need to decide is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>if we want to take that approach or follow one more along the lines of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>KDE and Gnome.  They use include exclude also but not per filename.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>More accurately Gnome/KDE use the base, 'include everything with x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>category in folder x' while denu has it just include a file in its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>structure.  The way denu does it now seems to have more control over the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>actual contents of the menu versus the other method.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Get your point. The freedesktop spec was designed for building
</I>&gt;<i>system-wide menus. It's actually pretty clever - when an application
</I>&gt;<i>installs itself it just has to drop files in specified locations and
</I>&gt;<i>it gets incorporated into the menu where ever the user likes that kind
</I>&gt;<i>of app. The complexity of the spec comes from that requirement, and
</I>&gt;<i>menu editing is a bit of an afterthought - to the point where it
</I>&gt;<i>wasn't until a month ago that a common 'user menu' file location was
</I>&gt;<i>decided on (which KDE 3.4's kmenuedit still does not use, BTW).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>So very true.  An example of this is that one of the games I installed 
started in fullscreen mode so I changed the entry to add '-w' to the 
command so it didn't.  With the freedesktop spec that would be done by 
hunting down the .desktop file and/or copying it to the user's directory 
so it didn't screw up everyones menu.

&gt;<i>But like you say, we are building *user* menus, not system ones.
</I>&gt;<i>Conceptually it's pretty different - Denu users see a tree of programs
</I>&gt;<i>and shuffle things about till they're happy. They don't want to see a
</I>&gt;<i>bunch of complex rules: it's the Gnome WM module's role to take care
</I>&gt;<i>of translating what they see into something gnome-menus understands.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I understand that abstraction.  I'm right with you.

&gt;<i>OK, if they're for a freedesktop WM we will probably want to give the
</I>&gt;<i>user the option to 'Add all programs in x category' and stuff like
</I>&gt;<i>that. But do we want to extend that functionality to other WMs? I
</I>&gt;<i>guess it would be nice, but could we? Let me think out loud...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>First off everything in the Denu app database would need to be
</I>&gt;<i>categorized. We could use the info in existing .desktop files as a
</I>&gt;<i>basis for this. Then if Denu is being used on a WM that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>support categorized menus, it would have to check on startup for new
</I>&gt;<i>programs, see what category they belong to, and offer the user the
</I>&gt;<i>choice to add them. That means it would need a way to remember the
</I>&gt;<i>user's category -&gt; menu preferences between sessions.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This idea of categories already exists within denu.  You can find its 
interpreter kinda thing in the autogen function or its equivalent.  Save 
your menu and have an empty you and click autofill.  If you were to look 
in the database you'd see something like this, '|Net|Browsers' per 
entry.  It defines that the entry needs to be put in the Browsers 
sub-menu of Net.  So what we could do is use those existing definitions 
to translate to categories.  We could also derive categories from the 
beginning of the portage as id as I call it.  For denu this is x11-misc 
and it could translate to the Utilities category.

&gt;<i>So yeah, it's doable. But I think it would either mean reinventing
</I>&gt;<i>most of the freedesktop system, or lifting it wholesale and using it
</I>&gt;<i>'internally' for saving Denu's menus, then translating them into
</I>&gt;<i>non-freedesktop menus when the user clicks 'save'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The way I see it, the pros are added functionality and leveraging an
</I>&gt;<i>open standard, the cons are added complexity and overhead. The
</I>&gt;<i>complexity part isn't really avoidable though, since we're parsing and
</I>&gt;<i>saving xdg menus for Gnome and KDE anyway. But still, it's a pretty
</I>&gt;<i>big shift, and a decision only you can make.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The idea of promoting an open standard seems to me, flawed.  I think 
that the freedesktop standard has flaws we've already discussed.  I also 
hesitate to call it a standard for all WMs because as far as I know its 
only a standard agreed upon by Gnome and KDE.  Both of which have 
different interests than many WMs.  Gnome/KDE  seem to lean toward the 
'all I want to do is check my email' crowd.  This is most prevalent with 
the absence of thought about adaptability when the standard was 
created.  A more sensible standard I believe is a simple text file with 
a standard format, not an XML which takes info from multitudes of 
files.  I lean toward making denu deal with the standard but not run of 
the standard.  I say this because I believe that the Free Desktop 
standard is unpolished and its success is undetermined.  Again I'll 
point to Xfce4's menus, they provide the best of both worlds.  I would 
have denu not cater to any WM especially the freedesktop spec because 
catering to one makes it tougher for others.  It seems that the audience 
of denu is between the 'all I want to do is check my email' user and the 
'I'll end the text files thank you very much' user.  It aims at the 'Yes 
I want to customize my menus but I dont want to find what I have 
installed and what its related binaries are called.

I feel that I should clarify about my role.  I may have sound harsh that 
I wanted to be a part of it.  I'm in it for the lesson and because it 
was an itch that needed to be scratched.  The reason I might have taken 
too much of a this is mine dont touch stance is because I'm afraid of 
someone more experienced than my self replacing me.  It still is my 
program but I love the help.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We also need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>consider the &lt;Layout&gt; tag because with the freedesktop spec order is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>specified by the &lt;layout&gt; tag NOT the order of the actual entries like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>all other WMs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not such a big deal - the pyxdg menu parser takes care of it for you,
</I>&gt;<i>and the WM module can translate any changes the user makes into to
</I>&gt;<i>required &lt;Layout&gt; tags. Leave that part to me ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Something tells me you'll be writing the FD module. ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>I think that its a definite possibility.  I have near to no experience
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>with XML and its really a matter of teaching myself.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's overhyped ;) You know what it looks like already, and
</I>&gt;<i>manipulating it with python's minidom is pretty easy once you get the
</I>&gt;<i>hang of it. Shout if you want some tutorial links.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Please.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>When you say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>internally in XML I'm confused on what that implies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was talking about the format Denu uses to save it's own version of
</I>&gt;<i>the user's menu between sessions. Right now it's pickling the
</I>&gt;<i>TreeStore, which works fine so long as they remain 'flat' - ie contain
</I>&gt;<i>a fixed number of columns. Saving them in XML is more flexible - they
</I>&gt;<i>could contain any number of 'columns' - and would mean that they could
</I>&gt;<i>be examined and edited by anyone with a text reader, but it's only one
</I>&gt;<i>format - there's lots of choices.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed.  In fact it would great as a menu standard.  lol

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I'm near Seattle.  I live just west, across Puget Sound from Seattle.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>realize thats pretty detailed but oh well.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No, not too detailed for this ex-Vancouverite! My family moved to
</I>&gt;<i>Sidney BC when I was eight then moved back here when I finished I
</I>&gt;<i>school. I decided the UK was crap and went back to Vancouver. But I've
</I>&gt;<i>bummed around the globe a bit since then, and am for some reason am
</I>&gt;<i>back here again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Cool.

&gt;&gt;<i>How's your weather?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A lovely spring day. And I'm tied to my computer :(
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ah, work?
