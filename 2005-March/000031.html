</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Awesome.  The more accurate the better.  Now we need to develop a better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>way of denu handling the menu.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In what way are you thinking?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I say that because if you look at the generated menu file by denu for 
that spec it is sloppy.  It includes multiple 
&lt;Include&gt;&lt;Filename&gt;file&lt;/Filename&gt;&lt;/Include&gt;.  What we need to decide is 
if we want to take that approach or follow one more along the lines of 
KDE and Gnome.  They use include exclude also but not per filename.  
More accurately Gnome/KDE use the base, 'include everything with x 
category in folder x' while denu has it just include a file in its 
structure.  The way denu does it now seems to have more control over the 
actual contents of the menu versus the other method.  We also need to 
consider the &lt;Layout&gt; tag because with the freedesktop spec order is 
specified by the &lt;layout&gt; tag NOT the order of the actual entries like 
all other WMs.

&gt;<i>Might be OT, but what do you think about the internal representation
</I>&gt;<i>of the menu being stored in XML? I dunno, maybe I've been hanging
</I>&gt;<i>around xdg too long ;) I remember you saying that at least one of the
</I>&gt;<i>WMs used XML to store the menus, and it's nice and intuitive and easy
</I>&gt;<i>to transform.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think that its a definite possibility.  I have near to no experience 
with XML and its really a matter of teaching myself.  When you say 
internally in XML I'm confused on what that implies.  I know XML as a 
structure in a text file.  Please fill me in.

&gt;<i>Not sure on the approach for displaying it in the gtk tree, however.
</I>&gt;<i>Three approaches - walk the XML tree creating the list for the tree,
</I>&gt;<i>write a TreeStore that works with XML  - basically the same thing,
</I>&gt;<i>encapsulated in a class (I'd be surprised if there wasn't one out
</I>&gt;<i>there already) or use something like:
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.logilab.org/projects/xmltools">http://www.logilab.org/projects/xmltools</A> - don't know if it handles
</I>&gt;<i>fancy stuff like drag-and-drop, though.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That would probably work.  I'll ponder it more once I understand this 
XML business.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yes I believe IF the app includes a .desktop file.  Not all do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yup. Would have to look at a way of generating missing .desktops from
</I>&gt;<i>the db for Gnome &amp; KDE. Not difficult - pyxdg includes a DesktopEntry
</I>&gt;<i>- the WM class just has to use that and it's hidden from Denu.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That shouldn't be hard.  Its the menu control files I'm more concerned with.

&gt;<i>Where abouts are you? GMT-8 looks like west coast USA. Hope your
</I>&gt;<i>weather's better than here in the UK!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm near Seattle.  I live just west, across Puget Sound from Seattle.  I 
realize thats pretty detailed but oh well.  Our weather has been 
unusually dry.  I believe they've already declared a draught, its bad 
news.  The ski season was non-existant because of no snow.  It was wierd 
because we had a wind storm yesterday, which I hinted at because the 
power wasa out.  How's your weather?
