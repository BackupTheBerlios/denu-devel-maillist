</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I apprecite your help so I'll be tolerant. :-D

&gt;<i>Am I right in thinking that the internal representation of the menu is

</I>&gt;<i>serialised and unserialised (cPickled) when saving and loading?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes the menu is stored in a TreeStore object with the saved files just 
being serialized objects.

&gt;<i>If so, I'm wondering how flexible this is long term. It looks to me
</I>&gt;<i>like the structure of the tree (the columns) is defined when it's
</I>&gt;<i>created. But what if you later decide to handle all the i18n stuff in
</I>&gt;<i>the freedesktop spec - you'd suddenly have a variable (or huge) number
</I>&gt;<i>of cols. Can you store objects in the tree? If so, would it make sense
</I>&gt;<i>to make an application object - analagous to a .desktop entry - to put
</I>&gt;<i>in the tree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'd assume so seeing as now I store a pixbuf in the treestore.  So I 
assume an object could be added.  You'd have to help with that because 
I've never used objects, I use arrays and lists.  If I'm making a fool 
of myself forgive me.

&gt;<i>I also don't understand why there's a separate store for menu icons.
</I>&gt;<i>What problem is that solving?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Its not solving any problem, its just a result of me adding it later.  
I'm assuming you are referring to the definitions as downloaded from the 
website.

&gt;<i>But my gut is telling me that the TreeStore object is actually the
</I>&gt;<i>wrong thing to be keeping menus in. I could be wrong, but to me it
</I>&gt;<i>just looks too much like a presentational object. Would it be better
</I>&gt;<i>to use the Menu object from pyxdg internally, perhaps extending it
</I>&gt;<i>with a .toTreeStore() method for the actual rendering? That way you'd
</I>&gt;<i>be handling the most complicated case 'natively' and are not
</I>&gt;<i>reinventing any wheels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We could do that.  However we'd have to make sure that we are not making 
denu prioritize the freedesktop spec over other window managers.  (I use 
fluxbox.)

&gt;<i>Anyways, those are my thoughts. I'll get on with the gnome menus for
</I>&gt;<i>now and let you know of what I run into.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Matt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks and if you need any help with the gnome menu I know quite a bit.  
If there one thing I have grasped by doing this is how each WM/DE's 
menus run, or atleast get their structure.
