</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>people can contribute the load/save stuff for whatever WM they want.
</I>&gt;<i>The trick is making sure that behind the scenes it can handle all
</I>&gt;<i>menuing things a WM might reasonably throw at it.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, and that will be a tough part.  An example would be fvwm because I 
believe the menu config is kept with all of the other settings in one 
file.  Another WM I need to look into further is e17.  I'm not sure how 
menus are handled within it.  Do we also want to include support for 
panels? Ex: pypanel, fbpanel.

&gt;<i>Should each WM be a separately-installed module? That would allow each
</I>&gt;<i>one to have it's own properties dialog for editing applications - ie
</I>&gt;<i>if the WM didn't support icons, the user wouldn't see the option. Just
</I>&gt;<i>a thought - not 100% how to implement something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think that a separate module is okay, such as it is now.  However, I 
think that a separate properties box is misleading/not possible with the 
current code because the WM being used is not detected by denu, the user 
selects which WM to generate for.

&gt;<i>What's your sense about the acceptance of the freedesktop.org spec -
</I>&gt;<i>do you think other WMs will migrate to it eventually?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good question.  My gut says eventually yes, but it will not be urgent.  
I say that because the text files, especially the xml ones are really 
easy to work with.  To say where its headed I'd say look at Xfce4, the 
user has the option to use the freedesktop spec if they want.  Or the 
user can just use the xml file.  What the freedesktop standards do is 
not only standardize the menus in gnome and KDE but also shifts the 
responsibility of including a program in the menu from the window 
manager to the developer/packager of the program.  I know that this is 
especially apparent now as the standard is just now introduced. 

I think that the single text file is not going to be obsolete for 
another reason.  The power user.  I know for a fact that not all users 
like GUI menu editors.  Look at this poll I posted originally when I 
started denu. 
<A HREF="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-218634-highlight-denu.html">http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-218634-highlight-denu.html</A>
11 users, 14% said its easy enough to edit by hand.  With the 
introduction of the freedesktop spec menu editing by hand is not easy. 
Period.  Program information is stored in .desktop files, directory 
information in .directory files and brought together by one or multiple 
.menu files.  This does not cater to those who do hand config.

&gt;<i>Certainly seems to be having a few teething trouble with the latest
</I>&gt;<i>KDE and Gnomes anyway ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Matt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>    Overall, I think the freedesktop specs create a better environment 
for new users and a more frustrating one for power users.  The specs 
solve problems apparent with many menu generation programs because the 
management is left to the package manager/the developer.  These problems 
include missing a program, having a wrong bit of information and in the 
case of editing by hand, not knowing what the executable(s) were named. 

    My response to these drawbacks was denu and it compensates for 
missing programs by being able to add them to denu which in turn submits 
it to the online database so the next time someone has the program it 
wont be missing.  This update via the internet also allows for 
'definitions' to be updated separate from the program, no emerge -u denu 
for a program update.  The definitions ability to be updated also allows 
the menu to update according to information. (However once an entry is 
in the menu portion it is untouched by denu and only edited by the 
user.)  The definitions also make knowing the executable not required.  
One only needs to know that in the case a program is not in the database.

    Another advantage of denu, since I'm on that, for gentooers is that 
it shows all programs that have a potential to be in a menu even if its 
not in the world file.

Thats a lot.  Thanks for your help.
