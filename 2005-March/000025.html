</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Alright, so the next question is what actions to we need to cover and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>how will the core look.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well, there's nothing in the core right now that loads menus from the
</I>&gt;<i>WM, only from Denu's own saved menu.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I guess that needs to be addressed: if we're doing a major rewrite,
</I>&gt;<i>will Denu continue to keep it's own version of the menu saved, or will
</I>&gt;<i>it work natively with the menu of the currently running WM, exporting
</I>&gt;<i>that to different formats at the user's request?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think it depends on how we want to set it up.  We could have both options.

&gt;<i>For BC, I think we'll need a 'Denu' WM class, that loads and saves the
</I>&gt;<i>~/.denu/lastmenu.p. The  real question is whether there's anything to
</I>&gt;<i>be gained by keeping our own copy of the menus in future... I suspect
</I>&gt;<i>there is, but am not thinking well enough right now to say what it is
</I>&gt;:|<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, along with this major rewrite we also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>should change to using glade.  Would each module be a separate package?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Do you mean, would a WM include glade files? Might be wrong, but there
</I>&gt;<i>shouldn't be any UI stuff attached to a WM, should there?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, I was just saying that if we are rewriting we might as well do that too.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>How would denu know what WMs are supported?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We need two things: a module install script, and a simple registry
</I>&gt;<i>that gets pickled and loaded at program startup. It will contain a
</I>&gt;<i>list of the installed WMs and their capabilities, I was thinking
</I>&gt;<i>something like:
</I>&gt;<i>    registry = {'Gnome' : {[stuff about gnome]}, 'FluxBox' : {[stuff
</I>&gt;<i>about fluxbox]}}
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I would have the registry just store the 'stuff'.  The installed WMs 
should be detected at startup.

&gt;<i>The install script is pretty simple. It:
</I>&gt;<i>    1. instantiates the WM class
</I>&gt;<i>    2. finds out it's name, capabilities, etc
</I>&gt;<i>    3. copies them to the registry
</I>&gt;<i>    4. saves the registry
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I could either be a separate script, or done with something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    $ denu --install-module /path/to/wm_module.py
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Prob separate would be simpler, since we don't want it firing up the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, separate.

&gt;<i>More suggestions for methods the WM classes might need to support
</I>&gt;<i>(thinking out load):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think in addition to capabilities, we'll need a property called
</I>&gt;<i>'signature'. This is the process we look for to detect if that WM is
</I>&gt;<i>running. So for Gnome:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    wm.signature = 'gnome-session'
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, definately.

&gt;<i>That should also get copied to the registry on install, to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i>overhead of instantiating every WM module at startup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We might also want:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   wm.system_commands = {'About' : '[command,icon,etc]', 'Help' :
</I>&gt;<i>'[command,etc]', ...}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This could be used for populating a WM-specific 'specials' box.
</I>&gt;<i>Doesn't need to be in the registry, though.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Or just a WM info box.

&gt;<i>My method list:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    wm.load()
</I>&gt;<i>    wm.save(menu)
</I>&gt;<i>    wm.getName()                  # needed by the installer
</I>&gt;<i>    wm.getIconThemePath()   # would only be needed if we were going to use
</I>&gt;<i>                                              # the current theme's
</I>&gt;<i>own folder/app icons
</I>&gt;<i>                                              # in Denu's UI
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'll bang out a working version of the WM class along with some test
</I>&gt;<i>scripts and send 'em over so we can start playing with it - it's
</I>&gt;<i>always much easier to understand when there's something functioning
</I>&gt;<i>there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've just had a couple of small jobs crop up, though, so might not get
</I>&gt;<i>to it until end of the weekend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, no problems.  I would like to make sure its we because I'd love to 
learn more.  When you want to I can hook you up as a dev.  That would 
allow us to use the svn.  It's no absolutely critical because I think 
we're on different time schedules so we wont be working on the code at 
the same time.

&gt;<i>I've also contacted the pyxdg developer about working together on the
</I>&gt;<i>editing functionality for that. He's right, it's not exactly a trivial
</I>&gt;<i>task, but helping develop that will help Denu deal with Gnome and KDE
</I>&gt;<i>too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, that would be another good way to give back.

&gt;<i>Is there any way to make <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/denu-devel">denu-devel at lists.berlios.de</A> automatically
</I>&gt;<i>make the 'Reply-To' go to the list, is there? I keep forgetting...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I just used reply to and deleted your email.  I don't know with gmail.
