<PRE>Hi,

Regarding recent discussion on how to handle all possible WMs, and now
possibly panels too: these are the challenges I see:

    1. Make it easy for us to maintain all the different possibilities for WMs 
        and panels
    2. Make it easy for 3rd parties to contribute their own WM/panel code
    3. Make it possible to add a new WM to Denu without reinstalling the 
        entire program
    4. Make it possible for Denu to know the capabilities of a given WM/panel
    5. Avoid requiring any WM-specific dependencies if a user doesn't have 
        that WM installed

Basically, I'd like to modularize WM management more than it is
already. All of the code below is for illustrative purposes only, but
here's how I've seen stuff like this done before...

Create a base (or skeleton) class, WM. This contains no functionality
of it's own except for creating subclasses, but defines an API that
all Denu-compliant WM modules must follow. Right now, it'd look
something like:

class WM:
&quot;&quot;&quot;Skeleton class for all WM-specific functionality&quot;&quot;&quot;

    # a dictionary defining the WM's capabilities
    capabilities = {}   

    def __init__(self):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialise the WMs capabilities&quot;&quot;&quot;
        self.capabilities = dict()                           # not
capable of anything

    def factory(type):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a WM instance of given type&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return eval(type + '()')
    factory = staticmethod(factory)

    def load(self):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns the existing menu&quot;&quot;&quot;
        raise WMError 'Not implemented'

   def save(self, menu):
   &quot;&quot;&quot;Save the given menu in the WMs format
       
       Returns true if save was successful&quot;&quot;&quot;
       raise WMError 'Not implemented'

A specific WM module would comprise a single file, containing a
subclass of WM. The developer would fill in the code required for the
load() and save() methods and say what the WM is capable of:

class Gnome(WM):
&quot;&quot;&quot;Gnome-specific WM functionality&quot;&quot;&quot;

    def __init__(self):
        WM.__init__(self)                            # inherit default
capabilities
        self.capabilities['themes'] = True  # Gnome can do themes
        # add other capabilities

    def load(self):
        menu = Menu();
        # ...add  stuff to menu...
        return menu

    def save(self, menu):
        # ...save the menu...
        return True

When a WM module is installed, it's capabilities are added to a Denu
Registry object, which is pickled and loaded at program startup. By
examing the Registry, Denu always knows which WMs (or panels) have
been installed, and what each can do.

Because the API is identical for all WMs, the rest of Denu doesn't
need to know any more about it, all it does when it needs to perform
WM-specific operations is intantiate one of the required type and call
a method:

    wm = WM.factory('Gnome')
    wm.save(menu)

Obviously there's other stuff that might need to be added to the basic
WM API - getVersion() springs to mind, but I haven't a clue whether
it's really needed. We'd need to iron those out, along with a list of
WM capabilities that each class should define.

Let me know what you think.

Matt
