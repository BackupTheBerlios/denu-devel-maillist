Get your point. The freedesktop spec was designed for building
system-wide menus. It's actually pretty clever - when an application
installs itself it just has to drop files in specified locations and
it gets incorporated into the menu where ever the user likes that kind
of app. The complexity of the spec comes from that requirement, and
menu editing is a bit of an afterthought - to the point where it
wasn't until a month ago that a common 'user menu' file location was
decided on (which KDE 3.4's kmenuedit still does not use, BTW).

But like you say, we are building *user* menus, not system ones.
Conceptually it's pretty different - Denu users see a tree of programs
and shuffle things about till they're happy. They don't want to see a
bunch of complex rules: it's the Gnome WM module's role to take care
of translating what they see into something gnome-menus understands.

OK, if they're for a freedesktop WM we will probably want to give the
user the option to 'Add all programs in x category' and stuff like
that. But do we want to extend that functionality to other WMs? I
guess it would be nice, but could we? Let me think out loud...

First off everything in the Denu app database would need to be
categorized. We could use the info in existing .desktop files as a
basis for this. Then if Denu is being used on a WM that doesn't
support categorized menus, it would have to check on startup for new
programs, see what category they belong to, and offer the user the
choice to add them. That means it would need a way to remember the
user's category -&gt; menu preferences between sessions.

So yeah, it's doable. But I think it would either mean reinventing
most of the freedesktop system, or lifting it wholesale and using it
'internally' for saving Denu's menus, then translating them into
non-freedesktop menus when the user clicks 'save'.

The way I see it, the pros are added functionality and leveraging an
open standard, the cons are added complexity and overhead. The
complexity part isn't really avoidable though, since we're parsing and
saving xdg menus for Gnome and KDE anyway. But still, it's a pretty
big shift, and a decision only you can make.

&gt;<i> We also need to
</I>&gt;<i> consider the &lt;Layout&gt; tag because with the freedesktop spec order is
</I>&gt;<i> specified by the &lt;layout&gt; tag NOT the order of the actual entries like
</I>&gt;<i> all other WMs.
</I>
Not such a big deal - the pyxdg menu parser takes care of it for you,
and the WM module can translate any changes the user makes into to
required &lt;Layout&gt; tags. Leave that part to me ;)

&gt;<i> I think that its a definite possibility.  I have near to no experience
</I>&gt;<i> with XML and its really a matter of teaching myself.  
</I>
It's overhyped ;) You know what it looks like already, and
manipulating it with python's minidom is pretty easy once you get the
hang of it. Shout if you want some tutorial links.

&gt;<i> When you say
</I>&gt;<i> internally in XML I'm confused on what that implies.
</I>
I was talking about the format Denu uses to save it's own version of
the user's menu between sessions. Right now it's pickling the
TreeStore, which works fine so long as they remain 'flat' - ie contain
a fixed number of columns. Saving them in XML is more flexible - they
could contain any number of 'columns' - and would mean that they could
be examined and edited by anyone with a text reader, but it's only one
format - there's lots of choices.

&gt;<i> I'm near Seattle.  I live just west, across Puget Sound from Seattle.  I
</I>&gt;<i> realize thats pretty detailed but oh well.  
</I>
No, not too detailed for this ex-Vancouverite! My family moved to
Sidney BC when I was eight then moved back here when I finished I
school. I decided the UK was crap and went back to Vancouver. But I've
bummed around the globe a bit since then, and am for some reason am
back here again.

&gt;<i> How's your weather?
</I>
A lovely spring day. And I'm tied to my computer :(
