</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Another WM I need to look into further is e17.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's one I _do_ have installed! The menus are directory based
</I>&gt;<i>(everything lives in ~/.e/e/applications) but uses a binary format for
</I>&gt;<i>each application file. Can't say I've looked at it much. I just used a
</I>&gt;<i>bunch of prebuilt eapp binary files and tutorial at:
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://aje.codewordt.co.uk/Files_files/applications.tar.gz">http://aje.codewordt.co.uk/Files_files/applications.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There's also e_utils - a bunch of utils to help create those binaries
</I>&gt;<i>- prob should begin with those for real integration, so we're not
</I>&gt;<i>limitted to what's in the tarball.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But that raises another question that's been at the back of my head -
</I>&gt;<i>dependencies. You don't want people to have to install e_utils if
</I>&gt;<i>they're not going to touch e17. Same sort of thing with pyxdg, really,
</I>&gt;<i>though it doesn't depend on anthing other than python so is prob OK.
</I>&gt;<i>Only two ways around it though: 1) rewrite or lift all the stuff
</I>&gt;<i>that's in them or 2) Have separate modules (with their own
</I>&gt;<i>dependencies) for each WM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, dependencies could quickly become a problem.  Especially in the
case of e17.  I would say that a good way of managing the deps is
needed.  We could rewrite/lift the functions but that would enlarge denu
and if we choose. the WM modules.

&gt;<i>But back to the e17 setup - the same format and general layout is used
</I>&gt;<i>by the applications menu, Engage and IBar. I know some people use
</I>&gt;<i>Engage with other WMs, so once we've got it cracked, that's a couple
</I>&gt;<i>of panels down...
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That would be a definite plus.  I know from using engage that I would
except the lack of easy configuration turns me off of it.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Do we also want to include support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>panels? Ex: pypanel, fbpanel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I guess yes, eventually it'd be good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Good question.  My gut says eventually yes, but it will not be urgent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yeah. If I were a WM developer I'd stick with what I'd got until the
</I>&gt;<i>dust settled a bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Interesting what you say about power users. I know one of the things
</I>&gt;<i>that the corporate sys admins (my brother's one) want is the ability
</I>&gt;<i>to &quot;lock down&quot; menus, so users cannot change them. Don't think any of
</I>&gt;<i>the menuing systems support this yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Seems like the freedesktop spec right now keeps it pretty locked down.
;-)  Unless of course they go through the pain of hand editing or use denu.

&gt;&gt;<i>    My response to these drawbacks was denu and it compensates for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>missing programs by being able to add them to denu which in turn submits
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it to the online database so the next time someone has the program it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>wont be missing.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yeah, it's a great idea. Haven't even looked at how you handle this
</I>&gt;<i>yet. Does SysUpdate query portage for installed apps, or look for
</I>&gt;<i>binaries directly?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Both.  The sysupdate function uses a variable ( config[&quot;portage&quot;] ) to
know if portage exists and if it does it uses the directories in
/var/db/pkg to find whats installed.  If portage is not found it gets a
list of all the files within the $PATH directories and runs them up
against a dict object which corresponds filenames to packages.  That
dict is exec_index.p .  Are you interested in becoming a dev?  IE access
to the svn repository and a rundown of the online dev utils.
