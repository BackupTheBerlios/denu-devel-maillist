<PRE>&gt;<i> As far as I know, all of the window managers including Gnome/KDE its a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of absolute file names in the .directory files.  We'd also have
</I>&gt;<i> to look into supporting themes via .directory files because as of now
</I>&gt;<i> its just done by user definition.  
</I>
Themes, yes, grrr... pyxdg includes a theme handling class,
IconTheme.py - haven't really looked at it. I guess the user will need
a way (simple checkbox?) when selecting an icon to indicate whether
they want it to change with the theme (in which case it's a relative
path - ie 'gvim.svg') or an absolute one. Again, this will differ
between WMs.
 
&gt;<i> Accelerator keys? Enlighten me.
</I>
Alt+F, Alt+S and stuff.

&gt;<i> Another WM I need to look into further is e17.
</I>
That's one I _do_ have installed! The menus are directory based
(everything lives in ~/.e/e/applications) but uses a binary format for
each application file. Can't say I've looked at it much. I just used a
bunch of prebuilt eapp binary files and tutorial at:
<A HREF="http://aje.codewordt.co.uk/Files_files/applications.tar.gz">http://aje.codewordt.co.uk/Files_files/applications.tar.gz</A>

There's also e_utils - a bunch of utils to help create those binaries
- prob should begin with those for real integration, so we're not
limitted to what's in the tarball.

But that raises another question that's been at the back of my head -
dependencies. You don't want people to have to install e_utils if
they're not going to touch e17. Same sort of thing with pyxdg, really,
though it doesn't depend on anthing other than python so is prob OK.
Only two ways around it though: 1) rewrite or lift all the stuff
that's in them or 2) Have separate modules (with their own
dependencies) for each WM.

But back to the e17 setup - the same format and general layout is used
by the applications menu, Engage and IBar. I know some people use
Engage with other WMs, so once we've got it cracked, that's a couple
of panels down...

&gt;<i> Do we also want to include support for
</I>&gt;<i> panels? Ex: pypanel, fbpanel.
</I>
I guess yes, eventually it'd be good.

&gt;<i> Good question.  My gut says eventually yes, but it will not be urgent.
</I>
Yeah. If I were a WM developer I'd stick with what I'd got until the
dust settled a bit.

Interesting what you say about power users. I know one of the things
that the corporate sys admins (my brother's one) want is the ability
to &quot;lock down&quot; menus, so users cannot change them. Don't think any of
the menuing systems support this yet.

&gt;<i>     My response to these drawbacks was denu and it compensates for
</I>&gt;<i> missing programs by being able to add them to denu which in turn submits
</I>&gt;<i> it to the online database so the next time someone has the program it
</I>&gt;<i> wont be missing.  
</I>
Yeah, it's a great idea. Haven't even looked at how you handle this
yet. Does SysUpdate query portage for installed apps, or look for
binaries directly?
