<PRE>Hola!

Not quite sure what I'm doing here, except I was bugging you lots on
the gentoo forums.

I think Denu has real potential - a menu editor that makes it easy to
take your setup from one WM to another has got to be a winner.

But I've got pretty dogmatic UI ideas. When I fire it up first time, I
want to see the existing menu for the WM I'm currently running as a
tree structure. Then I want to right-click on things to add, edit and
delete. I want a File &gt; Import menu item to let me suck in the menu
from another WM, and a File &gt; Export to save them for another WM.

Tell me to piss off if you don't agree.

Backend-wise that core shouldn't be difficult. Internally for Denu the
menu itself is just an object tree: once the API for that's sorted and
the UI is working, all the work is writing the import/export
functions. And from what I can tell, you've gone a long way to getting
that part down. Make that part modular and other people will find it
easy to contribute a plugin for their wm-de-jour.

I'm only just getting my head round the freedesktop.org menuing spec.
Like most specs, it stinks of being written by a committee. But that
doesn't make it bad - if the internal object model of Denu supports
that, with all it's OnlyIn and Exclude crap, you know it will support
just about anything another WM could throw at it.

Right now I'm between freelance gigs. I'm happy to brainstorm and do
stuff while that lasts. Like I said on one of my posts, I'm a
programmer, but not a python programmer. But from what I've seen from
the pyxdg sample scripts though, this stuff just doesn't look
impossible.

Anyway, let me know what your thoughts for Denu are.

Matt
