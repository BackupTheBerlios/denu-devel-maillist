</I>Matt,
I cannot express my gratitude for your criticism.  I agree that denu has 
a lot of potential.  Your ideas are very good ones.  The core of denu is 
in place (besides the import function) and its a matter now of focussing 
on the UI of denu.  I like the idea of it automatically importing the 
current menu.  There is pontential in that idea. 

However, I think that you are discounting how tough the import/export 
functions are to get right.  The idea of modularization is already 
present.  If you look in /usr/share/denu/wm you will see the files.  The 
tough part comes in the different styles menus are saved.  The majority 
of window managers use a single text file, example openbox/fluxbox. 
Others use a single text file for all of the configs, keybindings etc. 
example waimea (I believe).  Then there is the desktop menu spec in 
which the menu is generated from .desktop files in combination with a 
file which specifies categories and what to include and not include.  
examples gnome/kde(as of 3.4)  Xfce4 on the other hand is a combination 
of the two, its menu is stored in a file and all of the menu entry's 
info can be stored in that file or a simple tag can be added to include 
the desktop menu spec generated menu.  Enlightenment 16 stores its menus 
by keeping a menu file for each directory in the menu and then combining 
the files.  I think you get my point.  What it boils down to is three 
types, directory structured, file based and freedesktop spec.

Now the freedesktop spec has a wrinkle that need sto be ironed out in 
the way it determines order.  For each directory a &lt;layout&gt; tag must be 
included to order the entries.  This definition is separate from the 
&lt;include&gt; tag to include files.

Now don't discount yourself because you seem to be more of a 
programmer.  I'm a self taught programmer and denu is my first venture 
into python. I know I shouldn't admit that but it is.  Since I'm going 
to admit that I might as well state that I'm an 18 year old high school 
senior.  Ah, the wonders of the internet.  With that aside I put alot of 
time, generally in chunks into denu and intend to continue working on it 
because its an itch I thought needed to be scratched.  None of the other 
menu generation programs were up to snuff.

Also, a note.  If anyone happens to be a real/more experienced 
programmer than I and you read this (probably in the future) please 
critique my code.  Like I said I wrote denu as first of the language 
project.  Its main purpose is to learn from.

Thanks,
Scott
