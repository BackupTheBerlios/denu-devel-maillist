Well, there's nothing in the core right now that loads menus from the
WM, only from Denu's own saved menu.

I guess that needs to be addressed: if we're doing a major rewrite,
will Denu continue to keep it's own version of the menu saved, or will
it work natively with the menu of the currently running WM, exporting
that to different formats at the user's request?

For BC, I think we'll need a 'Denu' WM class, that loads and saves the
~/.denu/lastmenu.p. The  real question is whether there's anything to
be gained by keeping our own copy of the menus in future... I suspect
there is, but am not thinking well enough right now to say what it is
:|<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> Also, along with this major rewrite we also
</I>&gt;<i> should change to using glade.  Would each module be a separate package?
</I>
Do you mean, would a WM include glade files? Might be wrong, but there
shouldn't be any UI stuff attached to a WM, should there?

&gt;<i> How would denu know what WMs are supported?
</I>
We need two things: a module install script, and a simple registry
that gets pickled and loaded at program startup. It will contain a
list of the installed WMs and their capabilities, I was thinking
something like:
    registry = {'Gnome' : {[stuff about gnome]}, 'FluxBox' : {[stuff
about fluxbox]}}

The install script is pretty simple. It:
    1. instantiates the WM class
    2. finds out it's name, capabilities, etc
    3. copies them to the registry
    4. saves the registry

I could either be a separate script, or done with something like:

    $ denu --install-module /path/to/wm_module.py

Prob separate would be simpler, since we don't want it firing up the GUI.

More suggestions for methods the WM classes might need to support
(thinking out load):

I think in addition to capabilities, we'll need a property called
'signature'. This is the process we look for to detect if that WM is
running. So for Gnome:

    wm.signature = 'gnome-session'

That should also get copied to the registry on install, to avoid the
overhead of instantiating every WM module at startup.

We might also want:

   wm.system_commands = {'About' : '[command,icon,etc]', 'Help' :
'[command,etc]', ...}

This could be used for populating a WM-specific 'specials' box.
Doesn't need to be in the registry, though.

My method list:

    wm.load()
    wm.save(menu)
    wm.getName()                  # needed by the installer
    wm.getIconThemePath()   # would only be needed if we were going to use
                                              # the current theme's
own folder/app icons
                                              # in Denu's UI

I'll bang out a working version of the WM class along with some test
scripts and send 'em over so we can start playing with it - it's
always much easier to understand when there's something functioning
there.

I've just had a couple of small jobs crop up, though, so might not get
to it until end of the weekend.

I've also contacted the pyxdg developer about working together on the
editing functionality for that. He's right, it's not exactly a trivial
task, but helping develop that will help Denu deal with Gnome and KDE
too.

Is there any way to make <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/denu-devel">denu-devel at lists.berlios.de</A> automatically
make the 'Reply-To' go to the list, is there? I keep forgetting...
