Subject: [Denu-devel] Other Gnome 2.10 menu project and personal update.
Message-ID: <424C90E8.6030801@comcast.net>

Here is a link to a new editor for gnome 2.10.  Its more similar to a
menu editor such as kmenuedit.  Denu is still in its own league.  Check
it out here, http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=67 .

As of denu 3.x development its in the back of my mind and I have to
leave it there.  I have an English paper due on Tuesday and then I go to
Southern California on a choir trip.  My goal is to get the gui set and
the classes and variables etc. defined and then go in and code the
functions.  It is also going to include server-side changes to an xml
format for the database also.  If you guys have any ideas on this data
transfer let me know.
Thanks,
Scott

Yah - I did an ebuild for the 0.1 version a while back, but haven't checked 0.2:

OK, I'll do my best to get the promised WM classes across this
weekend. It's been fairly hectic for me since Easter :(

How do the updates work currently on the server side?

Hi Niklas,

I'm still working on the pyxdg editor - it basically works, but I'm
getting pretty bogged down with other stuff, and the pyxdg author is
in a similar position and hasn't committed my changes. But I'm always
happy to share code :D

My aim is to integrate it with Denu, another cross-wm menu editor:
Denu's actively looking for contributors right now - hope you don't
mind me CC-ing this to their list.

Matt

Hello

What a coincidence, I actually planned calling my program DMenu, or
DMenus... And no, I don't mind your CC-ing, however, Denu doesn't either
seem to be the kind of project that I searched for. What I planned was
this:

* Provide some sort of a default system-wide applications.menu file
which include all possible categories.

* Generate menus with a simple command, that can be included for example
in .xinit, so that users always will have up-to-date menus.

As I understand it, you want to create a gui program to manipulate
applications.menu files, which of course also is needed. The thing is, I
do not feel a need for a gui.

About the name... this is the primary reason i forward this mail to the
Denu mailing-list; what do you think, would it be okay that I call my
program DMenu (for Desktop Menu), or should I come up with something
different? There is a chance that people would mix the names...

Kindly answer directly to this my email when you have come to a
conclusion, as I'm not registered.
